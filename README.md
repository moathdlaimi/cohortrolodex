## MVP

As a user when I first visit the app I can see the index of existing users and I can view their profile details. As a user I have the ability to sign up and create my own profile which will be added to the index. As a user once i have signed up I may come back to the site and login with my username and password. As a user once I have created a profile I have the ability to edit and/or delete my profile which will update or remove it from the index. As a user I am not able to edit or delete any profile but my own. As a user I am met with a simple, intuitive UX and a clean logical UI.

## Technologies

- MEAN stack

- Postman

## Approach

We began by establishing preferred work styles. Given that this was a brand new experience for us all there was a lot of ambiguity around how we would approach this challenge. Implementing an agile methodology, frequent peer programming, and open and honest communication allowed us to test early and often and quickly fix bugs as they arose. Communicating often helped minimize working in the same files and creating merge conflicts.

## Unsolved Problems

- Users can upload a profile image instead of using a url

- User can update user name and password

- Users can search by name, skills, keywords, etc

- Login and signup bar transforms into forms on click

## Lessons Learned

- The smallest part of the project was coding, while working in a group and planning was the foundation of our assignment

- Learned the importance of planning and having working design files before we started the project

- The importance of having a leader to make the hard calls for the benefit of the group and make sure everyone isn't going too far off with ideas.

- Time commitments is important for tackling a group assignment.

- It's important to to remember that when in a group you always have someone to lean on.

- It's good to be in a group where you can learn stuff from other people and absorb their knowledge.
