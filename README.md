## MVP
As a user when I first visit the app I can see the index of existing users and I can view their profile details. As a user I have the ability to sign up and create my own profile which will be added to the index. As a user once i have signed up I may come back to the site and login with my username and password. As a user once I have created a profile I have the ability to edit and/or delete my profile which will update or remove it from the index. As a user I am not able to edit or delete any profile but my own. As a user I am met with a simple, intuitive UX and a clean logical UI.

## Approach
We began by establishing preferred work styles. Given that this was a brand new experience for us all there was a lot of ambiguity around how we would approach this challenge. Implementing an agile methodology, frequent peer programming, and open and honest communication allowed us to test early and often and quickly fix bugs as they arose. Communicating often helped minimize working in the same files and creating merge conflicts.

## Unsolved Problems
-Users can upload a profile image instead of using a url
-User can update user name and password
-Users can search by name, skills, keywords, etc
-Login and signup bar transforms into forms on click
